## What Is This
This project will hold multiple machine learning challenges and my solutions to them. All of these projects will use C#.

## [Getting-Started](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/ml-dotnet/get-started-tutorial/create)
This project is the first one created in order to get the basic understanding of ML.NET. This project is featured on the ML.net site and guides you through the steps. The project uses ML to predict sentiments of comments using a text file of comments as the data. It then creates a model based on the training time and data. With this model, it is able to predict the sentiment of text.

## [Iris Flower Classification](https://medium.com/gft-engineering/start-to-learn-machine-learning-with-the-iris-flower-classification-challenge-4859a920e5e3) 
This challenge will use machine learning to learn the different species of Iris flowers and then classify them automatically.
