## What Is This
This project will hold multiple machine learning challenges and my solutions to them. All of these projects will use C#.

## [Iris Flower Classification](https://medium.com/gft-engineering/start-to-learn-machine-learning-with-the-iris-flower-classification-challenge-4859a920e5e3) 
This challenge will use machine learning to learn the different species of Iris flowers and then classify them automatically.
